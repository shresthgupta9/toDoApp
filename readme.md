ToDo App developed by using both frontend and backend technologies.

The frontend is developed using react.js and the backend is developed using node.js and express.js.

The database functionality is handled using MongoDB.

To run this app first install dependencies of both clientend and nodeserver using "npm i" command. Then run "npm start" in both both folders(first in nodeserver folder and then in clientend folder to ensure smooth initialization).
